# Database Security User Guide

## User Management

### Creating New Users


To create new users in the system, follow these steps:

1. **Access the User Management Interface**
   - Log in to the system with administrator credentials
   - Navigate to the User Management section

2. **Fill in User Details**
   - Username: Enter a unique username for the new user
   - Password: Create a secure password following these requirements:
     - Minimum 8 characters
     - Mix of uppercase and lowercase letters
     - At least one number
     - At least one special character
   - Role: Select one of the following roles:
     - Administrator: Full system access and user management capabilities
     - Data Analyst: Can view, add, modify and delete data
     - Reader: Read-only access to data

3. **Submit the Form**
   - Click the "Create User" button to create the account
   - The system will validate the information
   - If successful, the new user will appear in the users list

### Important Security Guidelines

- Each user should have their own unique account
- Never share login credentials
- Passwords should be changed every 90 days
- Choose the most restrictive role that still allows the user to perform their duties

### Role Permissions

**Administrator Role**
- Full access to all database operations
- Can create and manage other users
- Can perform database backups and restores
- Has access to system configuration

**Data Analyst Role**
- Can view all data
- Can add new records
- Can modify existing records
- Can delete records
- Cannot create users or modify system settings

**Reader Role**

### Best Practices

1. Regularly review user access levels
2. Remove accounts for users who no longer need access
3. Audit user activities periodically
4. Document any changes to user permissions
5. Train users on security protocols before granting access
